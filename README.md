# SmartUtilBot - Project Archive Note 😢

After pouring my heart and soul into **SmartUtilBot** for one year, I am deeply saddened to announce that I will no longer be updating this project. 😔 I built this Telegram bot from scratch, using a combination of Pyrogram and Telethon, with every line of code written by me without copying or using anyone else's work without permission. My goal was to create a cool bot like SmartUtilBot, deeply inspired by the functionality of bots like @SmartUtilBot that means almost same ui , but entirely my own creation Cause It Still Different From Official SmartUtilBot. BTW Sorry For Making This.💔

Unfortunately, the accusations of being a "copycat" Or "copyninja" from members of the @SmartUtilBot support chat and others in my DMs have taken a heavy toll on my spirit. These words have deeply hurt me, and despite my efforts to create an original project, the negativity has made it difficult to continue. 😞 I have always respected the work of others and would never use code without proper authorization or credit.

To the admins and community of @SmartUtilBot, I sincerely apologize if my project caused any misunderstanding. 🙏 I never intended to disrespect your work. I hope you can forgive me, and I will step away from further development of SmartUtilFork or similar projects.Kindly Forgive Me And Don't Say "CopyCat" or "Copy Ninja" It Hurts Too Bad 🥺.

# Thank you to anyone who supported me during this journey. This project will remain archived as a reminder of the hard work and passion I invested, even if it was met with heartbreak. 😢
